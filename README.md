My journey,

I'm Inchara H Suresh, currently working on the domain of Data Science at OASIS INFOBYTE. I am a Computer Scince Engineering final-year Undergrad at Sai Vidya Insitute of Technology. I am quite deterministic and ambitious which enables me to complete my tasks on time, making me do things at ease.
During my 6th semester, I was eager to take up an internship so that I could use my knowledge and skills in order to keep learning and developing. LinkedIn as the medium to get to know about openings for internship. I received a Oasis Infobyte internship link from my friend and I immediately applied for the web development internship.
The following are the tasks I completed:
Task no 1: Iris flower Classification
Task no 4: Email spam Detection
task no 5: Sales prediction using python
